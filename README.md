# Objects: Media Library

This was a project I wanted to make to cement my knowledge of JavaScript objects, classes, and class inheritence. Through Codecademy there was an exercise to produce a media library using this skillset. Whilst there was hands-off guidance provided I decided to try and do everything myself (with a little help from Google)

### Comments & Thought Process

I have actually spent more time with Python objects and classes than JavaScript ones, but I always found them confusing. There's something about JavaScript that just <em>clicks</em> for me, and for the first time I had fun writing objects and classes. This is a really good project to learn from, and I can see how valuable this method of writing JS will be in the future. If anything it makes me wish I started this sooner! 

There is a for loop in the code that can probably be replaced by a .reduce() function but for the moment I want to stick to pure loops so that I can really build my skillset in that area before using pre-defined methods.
